TEMPLATE, HTML AND CSS

..............................................................................................

Started the project by parts, first the head then the body, then inside the body start with the header.
Divide it with DIV and NAV, but after a better analysis, I realized that I could more easily follow the spacing specifications without the DIV. Although I use relative measurements in my projects, I have specifications to follow and since I had not worked following the guidelines of a designer, I believe my only option is to use absolute measurements directly in the header as a parent.

Also realize that the specified font did not match the designer and the name Regular generated error in chrome. After some research on the internet, I found that the helvetica Neue font has some problems with chrome, but I haven't found a solution yet, so I decided to use only helvetica for now.

For the product display part I used two DIVs to align the two product lines, each with four product displays. I used an unordered list for each product. For the option to send and share I used a FORM.
Seeing that I used absolute measurements, I noticed that when the screen changes size the elements move and become misaligned, but I have not yet found a way to follow the given parameters and make the screen responsive. Still working on it.

Relative measures were used, in this case the percentage, for the best usability of the page, thus reducing the number of element misalignment when changing the screen size.
