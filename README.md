Starting challenge

Started the project by parts, first the head then the body, then inside the body start with the header.
Divide it with DIV and NAV, but after a better analysis, I realized that I could more easily follow the spacing specifications without the DIV. Although I use relative measurements in my projects, I have specifications to follow and since I had not worked following the guidelines of a designer, I believe my only option is to use absolute measurements directly in the header as a parent.

Also realize that the specified font did not match the designer and the name Regular generated error in chrome. After some research on the internet, I found that the helvetica Neue font has some problems with chrome, but I haven't found a solution yet, so I decided to use only helvetica for now.
